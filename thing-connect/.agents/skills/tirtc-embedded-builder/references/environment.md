# ESP-IDF environment

Run the doctor before generation, build, flash, or monitor:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/doctor.py \
  --expected-idf 5.5 \
  --target esp32s3
```

Add `--project <generated-project>` after generation so the doctor can compare `sdkconfig` or `sdkconfig.defaults` with the TiRTC SDK build contract. Use `--json` when the result will be included in another report.

## Required checks

- `python3`, `git`, `idf.py`, and the target compiler are available in the active shell;
- `idf.py --version` matches the project's required ESP-IDF line;
- `IDF_PATH` is coherent when set;
- the TiRTC SDK contains its header, archive, and `manifest/build-contract.env`;
- generated Kconfig values explicitly match TiRTC's FreeRTOS ABI-sensitive contract;
- the requested serial port exists and is writable before flash or monitor.

CMake and Ninja are reported separately because an activated ESP-IDF environment may provide or select its own managed versions.

## Missing ESP-IDF

Checking is read-only. Installing ESP-IDF downloads code and tools, consumes disk space, and may change the developer's shell setup, so perform it only after the user approves the exact version, install directory, supported target, and shell activation method.

For an approved installation:

1. Confirm the project and TiRTC package require the same ESP-IDF major/minor line. This repository's current ESP32-S3 starter requires 5.5.x.
2. Consult the current official Espressif installation instructions for the developer's operating system.
3. Install a pinned 5.5.x release into a user-approved directory; enable the `esp32s3` target and keep the vendor installer logs.
4. Activate the installed environment in the current shell. Modify a persistent shell profile only when the user explicitly requests it.
5. Rerun the doctor. Installation is complete only when the IDF version, compiler, SDK files, and project contract checks pass.

When downloads, package installation, administrator rights, USB drivers, or group membership are required, surface the exact action and obtain the applicable authorization instead of treating it as an ordinary code edit.

## Existing but inactive ESP-IDF

If `IDF_PATH/tools/idf.py` exists but `idf.py` or the target compiler is absent from `PATH`, report the environment as inactive. Activate that installation using its vendor-provided export script and rerun the doctor; do not install a second copy merely because the current shell is inactive.
